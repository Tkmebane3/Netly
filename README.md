# Netly
*Ongoing project* An expansion of my network database project. This version will use Python's FastAPI and SQL Alchemy framework to create a web application. The web application will include features to add a new connection, view all recorded connections, and ultimately leverage an AI agent to send check-ins to connections that have documented contact information.
